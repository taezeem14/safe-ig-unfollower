# Safe IG Unfollower (Dry-Run)

This is a **safe educational demo tool** that simulates an Instagram unfollower bot using Bash + curl.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This script does **not** unfollow by default. It runs in **dry-run mode**, meaning it only shows what it *would* do. To enable actual unfollowing, you must manually set `EXECUTE=1` in the script.
